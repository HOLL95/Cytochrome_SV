# Contributing to Pints

If you'd like to contribute to Pints (thanks!), please have a look at the [guidelines below](#workflow).

If you're already familiar with our workflow, maybe have a quick look at the [pre-commit checks](#pre-commit-checks) directly below.

## Pre-commit checks

Before you commit any code, please perform the following checks:

- [No style issues](#coding-style-guidelines): `$ flake8`
- [All tests pass](#testing): `$ python run-tests.py --unit`
- [The documentation builds](#building-the-documentation): `$ cd docs` and then `$ make clean; make html`

You can even run all three at once, using `$ python run-tests.py --quick`.


## Workflow

We use [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) to coordinate our work. When making any kind of update, we try to follow the procedure below.

### A. Before you begin

1. Create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) where new proposals can be discusssed before any coding is done.
2. Create a [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) of this repo (ideally on your own [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)), where all changes will be made
3. Download the source code onto your local system, by [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository (or your fork of the repository).
4. [Install](#installation) Pints with the developer options.
5. [Test](#testing) if your installation worked, using the test script: `$ python run-tests.py --unit`.

You now have everything you need to start making changes!

### B. Writing your code

5. Pints is developed in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and makes heavy use of [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy) (see also [NumPy for MatLab users](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) and [Python for R users](http://blog.hackerearth.com/how-can-r-users-learn-python-for-data-science)).
6. Make sure to follow our [coding style guidelines](#coding-style-guidelines).
7. Commit your changes to your branch with useful, descriptive commit messages: Remember these are publically visible and should still make sense a few months ahead in time. While developing, you can keep using the github issue you're working on as a place for discussion. [Refer to your commits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8910271/how-can-i-reference-a-commit-in-an-issue-comment-on-github) when discussing specific lines of code.
8. If you want to add a dependency on another library, or re-use code you found somewhere else, have a look at [these guidelines](#dependencies-and-reusing-code).

### C. Merging your changes with Pints

9. [Test your code!](#testing)
10. Pints has online documentation at http://pints.readthedocs.io/. To make sure any new methods or classes you added show up there, please read the [documentation](#documentation) section.
11. If you added a major new feature, perhaps it should be showcased in an [example notebook](#example-notebooks).
12. When you feel your code is finished, or at least warrants serious discussion, run the [pre-commit checks](#pre-commit-checks) and then create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) (PR) on [Pints' GitHub page](https://github.com/pints-team/pints).
13. Once a PR has been created, it will be reviewed by any member of the community. Changes might be suggested which you can make by simply adding new commits to the branch. When everything's finished, someone with the right GitHub permissions will merge your changes into Pints master repository.

Finally, if you really, really, _really_ love developing Pints, have a look at the current [project infrastructure](#infrastructure).



## Installation

To install Pints with all developer options, use:

```
$ pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

This will

1. Install all the dependencies for Pints, including the ones for documentation (docs) and development (dev).
2. Tell Python to use your local pints files when you use `import pints` anywhere on your system.



## Coding style guidelines

Pints follows the [PEP8 recommendations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for coding style. These are very common guidelines, and community tools have been developed to check how well projects implement them.

We use [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to check our PEP8 adherence. To try this on your system, navigate to the Pints directory in a console and type

```
$ flake8
```

When you commit your changes they will be checked against flake8 automatically (see [infrastructure](#infrastructure)).

### Naming

Naming is hard. In general, we aim for descriptive class, method, and argument names. Avoid abbreviations when possible without making names overly long, so `mean` is better than `mu`, but a class name like `AdaptiveMCMC` is fine.

Class names are CamelCase, and start with an upper case letter, for example `SuperDuperMCMC`. Method and variable names are lower case, and use underscores for word separation, for example `x` or `iteration_count`.

### Spelling

To be consistent with the work so far, all PINTS material in the repository (code, comments, docstrings, documentation, etc.) should be written in UK english, the only exception being when quoting other sources, e.g. titles of scientific articles in references.

### Python 2 and 3

Python is currently in a long, long transition phase from Python 2 to Python 3. Pints supports both Python 2 (version 2.7 and upwards) and Python 3 (version 3.4 and upwards).
The easiest way to write code that works on both versions is to write for Python 3, (avoiding the more spectacular new features) and [then test on both versions](#testing).

In addition, most scripts start with these lines:

```
from __future__ import absolute_import, division
from __future__ import print_function, unicode_literals
```

These [future imports](https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html) are ignored by Python 3, but tell Python 2 to mimmick some of its features. Notably, the ``division`` package changes the result of ``3 / 2`` from ``1`` to ``1.5`` (this means you can write ``1 / x`` instead of ``1.0 / x``).


## Dependencies and reusing code

While it's a bad idea for developers to "reinvent the wheel", it's important for users to get a _reasonably sized download and an easy install_. In addition, external libraries can sometimes cease to be supported, and when they contain bugs it might take a while before fixes become available as automatic downloads to Pints users.
For these reasons, all dependencies in Pints should be thought about carefully, and discussed on GitHub.

Direct inclusion of code from other packages is possible, as long as their license permits it and is compatible with ours, but again should be considered carefully and discussed in the group. Snippets from blogs and stackoverflow can often be included without attribution, but if they solve a particularly nasty problem (or are very hard to read) it's often a good idea to attribute (and document) them, by making a comment with a link in the source code.

### Separating dependencies

On the other hand... We _do_ want to compare several tools, to generate documentation, and to speed up development. For this reason, the dependency structure is split into 4 parts:

1. Core Pints: A minimal set, including things like NumPy, SciPy, etc. All infrastructure should run against this set of dependencies, as well as any numerical methods we implement ourselves.
2. Extras: Other inference packages and their dependencies. Methods we don't want to implement ourselves, but do want to provide an interface to can have their dependencies added here.
3. Documentation generating code: Everything you need to generate and work on the docs.
4. Development code: Everything you need to do Pints development (so all of the above packages, plus flake8 and other testing tools).

Only 'core pints' is installed by default. The others have to be specified explicitly when running the installation command.

### Matplotlib

We use Matplotlib in Pints, but with two caveats:

First, Matplotlib should only be used in plotting methods, and these should _never_ be called by other Pints methods. So users who don't like Matplotlib will not be forced to use it in any way. Use in notebooks is OK and encouraged.

Second, Matplotlib should never be imported at the module level, but always inside methods. For example:

```
def plot_great_things(self, x, y, z):
    import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
    ...
```

This allows people to (1) use Pints without ever importing Matplotlib and (2) configure Matplotlib's back-end in their scripts, which _must_ be done before e.g. `pyplot` is first imported.


## Testing

All code requires testing. We use the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.html) package for our tests. (These tests typically just check that the code runs without error, and so, are more _debugging_ than _testing_ in a strict sense. Nevertheless, they are very useful to have!)

To run quick tests, use

```
$ python run-tests.py --unit
```

### Writing tests

Every new feature should have its own test. To create ones, have a look at the `test` directory and see if there's a test for a similar method. Copy-pasting this is a good way to start.

Next, add some simple (and speedy!) tests of your main features. If these run without exceptions that's a good start! Next, check the output of your methods using any of these [assert methods](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods).

Guidelines for writing unit tests:

1. Unit tests should test a very small block of code (e.g. a single method)
1b. When writing tests, start from the simplest case, and then work up
2. Unit tests _test the public API_ (i.e. they never access private methods or variables). They test _if_ the code does what it promises to do, not _how_ it does it. For example, after running `my_object.set_x(4)`, you might check if `my_object.x()` returns 4, but you never check if `my_object._x == 4`: how the object stores its data is its own business.
3. There are hundreds of unit tests, and good developers run all of them several times a day. Therefore, unit tests should be _fast_.
4. If you're testing something stochastic, seed the number generator as part of the test, i.e. with `np.random.seed(1)`.

### Running more tests

If you want to check your tests on Python 2 and 3, use

```
$ python2 run-tests.py --unit
$ python3 run-tests.py --unit
```

When you commit anything to Pints, these checks will also be run automatically (see [infrastructure](#infrastructure)).

### Testing notebooks

To test all example notebooks, use

```
$ python run-tests.py --books
```

If notebooks fail because of changes to pints, it can be a bit of a hassle to debug. In these cases, you can create a temporary export of a notebook's Python content using

```
$ python run-tests.py -debook examples/notebook-name.ipynb script.py
```


## Documentation

Pints is documented in several ways.

First and foremost, every method and every class should have a [docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) that describes in plain terms what it does, and what the expected input and output is.

These docstrings can be fairly simple, but can also make use of [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html), a markup language designed specifically for writing [technical documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText). For example, you can link to other classes and methods by writing ```:class:`pints.ForwardModel` ``` and  ```:meth:`run()` ```.

In addition, we write a (very) small bit of documentation in separate reStructuredText files in the `docs` directory. Most of what these files do is simply import docstrings from the source code. But they also do things like add tables and indexes. If you've added a new class to a module, search the `docs` directory for that module's `.rst` file and add your class (in alphabetical order) to its index. If you've added a whole new module, copy-paste another module's file and add a link to your new file in the appropriate `index.rst` file.

Using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) the documentation in `docs` can be converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats. In particular, we use it to generate the documentation on http://pints.readthedocs.io/

### Docstring template

1. Each docstring should start with a single sentence explaining what it does.

2. If desired, this can be followed by a blank line and one or several
   paragraphs providing a more detailed explanation. These paragraphs can
   include code snippets or use LaTeX expressions for mathematics (see below).

3. If the class is a subclass of some other PINTS type, it may be good to
   mention this here. For example:
   
        Extends :class:`SingleChainMCMC`.

4. Simple arguments can be described textually. For example, a docstring could
   be a single line "Sets the width parameter to `w`.". For complicated
   functions or methods it may be good to include a parameters section:
   
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : int
            A variable `x` that should be an integer
        y
            A variable without a type hint
            
   This syntax can also be used for constructor arguments.
   Note that default values for any arguments are already displayed
   automatically in the function/method/constructor signature.
   
5. Simple return types can be described textually, but complicated return types
   (which are not encouraged) can use the syntax:
   
        Returns
        -------
        samples
            A list of samples.
        likelihoods
            A list of their corresponding log-likelihoods
            
6. References to literature are highly encouraged, and go near the bottom of
   the docstring:
   
        Adaptive covariance MCMC based on Haario et al. [1]_, [2]_.
        
        (rest of the docstring goes here)
   
        References
        ----------
        .. [1] Johnstone, Chang, Bardenet, de Boer, Gavaghan, Pathmanathan,

   There is no standard format (e.g. APA style), but authors, titles, years,
   and journals are recommended, as well as a link based on a
   [DOI](https://www.doi.org/).
   
7. Longer code snippets can go at the very end of a docstring

        Examples
        --------
        ::

            errors = [
                pints.MeanSquaredError(problem1),
                pints.MeanSquaredError(problem2),
            ]
            
            # Equally weighted
            e1 = pints.SumOfErrors(errors)

            # Differrent weights:
            weights = [
                1.0,
                2.7,
            ]
            e2 = pints.SumOfErrors(errors, weights)

### Using code in documentation

When referencing a variable in a docstring, please use the syntax ` ``x`` `.
Longer code snippets can be started using this form:

    """
    An example follows here::
    
        print('Hello world')

    """        

### Using Maths in documentation

LaTeX expressions can be embedded in docstrings by using the syntax ```:math:`expression```` for inline mathematics, or a longer form for multi-line strings:

    r"""
        Defines a :math:`\gamma` (log) prior with given shape parameter ``a`` 
        and rate parameter ``b``, with pdf

        .. math::
            f(x|a,b)=\frac{b^a x^{a-1} e^{-bx}}{\mathrm{\Gamma}(a)}
    
    """
    
Note that when using maths, it is best to define the docstring in a *raw string*, i.e. by writing ```r""" your stuff here """```. This will allow you to write e.g. `1 + \tau` instead of `1 + \\tau` and will stop flake8 from complaining about invalid escape sequences. See https://github.com/pints-team/pints/issues/735.

### Building the documentation

To test and debug the documentation, it's best to build it locally. To do this, make sure you have the relevant dependencies installed (see [installation](#installation)), navigate to your pints directory in a console, and then type:

```
cd docs
make clean
make html
```

Next, open a browser, and navigate to your local pints directory (by typing the path, or part of the path into your location bar). Then have a look at `<your pints path>/docs/build/html/index.html`.


### Example notebooks

Major Pints features are showcased in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) stored in the [examples directory](examples). Which features are "major" is of course wholy subjective, so please discuss on GitHub first!

All example notebooks should be listed in [examples/README.md](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/examples/README.md). Please follow the (naming and writing) style of existing notebooks where possible.

Where possible, notebooks are tested daily. A list of slow notebooks (which time-out and fail tests) is maintained in `.slow-books`, these notebooks will be excluded from daily testing.


## Infrastructure

### Version number

A central version number is stored in `pints/version`.

### Setuptools

Installation of Pints _and dependencies_ is handled via [setuptools](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/)

Configuration files:

```
setup.py
MANIFEST.in
```

The `MANIFEST.in` file is used to list non-Python files to be included in the installation.

### PIP

It's always worth using an up-to-date version of pip. On older systems especially, having an up-to-date pip will prevent all kinds of version incompatibility issues:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Travis CI

All committed code is tested using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), tests are published on https://travis-ci.org/pints-team/pints.

Configuration files:

```
.travis.yaml
```

Unit tests and flake8 testing is done for every commit. A nightly cronjob also tests the notebooks. Notebooks listed in `.slow-books` are excluded from these tests.

### Appveyor

Windows testing is done using [appveyor](http://appveyor.com/), tests are published on https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MichaelClerx/pints.

Configuration files:

```
.appveyor.yml
```

See ([here](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml/)) for the syntax.


### Codecov

Code coverage (how much of our code is actually seen by the (linux) unit tests) is tested using [Codecov](https://docs.codecov.io/), a report is visible on https://codecov.io/gh/pints-team/pints.

Configuration files:

```
.coveragerc
```

### Read the Docs

Documentation is built using https://readthedocs.org/ and published on http://pints.readthedocs.io/.

Configuration files:

```
.requirements-docs.txt
```

### Binder

Editable notebooks are made available using [Binder](mybinder.readthedocs.io) at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pints-team/pints/master?filepath=examples.

Configuration files:

```
postBuild
```

### Flake8

[Style checking](#coding-style-guidelines) is performed using [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).

Configuration files:

```
.flake8
```

### GitHub

GitHub does some magic with particular filesnames. In particular:

- The first page people see when they go to [our GitHub page](https://github.com/pints-team/pints) displays the contents of [README.md](README.md), which is written in the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format. Some guidelines can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/).
- The license for using Pints is stored in [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt), and [automatically](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/) linked to by GitHub.
- This file, [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) is recognised as the contribution guidelines and a link is [automatically](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines) displayed when new issues or pull requests are created.
